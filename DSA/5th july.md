1.what shoud be the minimum requirement of a table so that we can store data in database without any anamoly ?
2. what is the difference between seald and yield in java ?

.Spinning tree - A spanning tree of a connected undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all vertices of the original graph and is also a tree.
.Minimum Spinning tree - A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted, undirected graph that connects all the vertices together without forming any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 

1.Kruskal's Algorithm - Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or a Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) for an undirected, edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a single MST; otherwise, it finds an MSF, which is a collection of MSTs for each connected component.
Steps are :- 
i. remove all self loop.
ii. remove all parallel edges.
ii. Now sort all the edges in ascending order on the basis of thir weight.
. No of edge = No of vertices - 1;
